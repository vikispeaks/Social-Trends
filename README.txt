Project Assessment:
YouTube Trends is a front-end application that was developed in a hurry to show the latest video trends from YouTube.

Right now it's showing the latest trends only for the United States, but we would like to have a possibility of selecting a specific country to see the latest trends there. (see dropdown_mockup.png)

When we're trying to open some video to play it doesn't work and shows some errors in console, please fix these bugs.

Also, we plan to extend our application and add Twitter, Facebook trends in future, it would be good to split our features into modules, could you please do it just for the "Youtube" feature.

Notes:
* List of countries can be found in app.config file
* You may add new dependencies in package.json (if needed)

Tasks:
* Implement country search and switch YouTube trends by selected country in header.component 
* Fix bugs in player.component
* Refactor loadVideos and getVideoStats methods in youtube.component to follow Angular best practices
